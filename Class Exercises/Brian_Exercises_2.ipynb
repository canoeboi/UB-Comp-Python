    "    * A float\n",
    "    * A string\n",

    "Most physics students are familiar with vertical motion problems. To start lets write the 3 kinematic equations of motion. I have included the equations below in latex syntax and recommend you try to practice writing equations using this format. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_f = v_i + a t $$\n",
    "$$y = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$\n",

    "1. Consider a ball that starts from the ground with an initial speed of 10 m/s and acceleration due to gravity being -10 m/s$^2$. The ball goes up, reaches a maximum height, and falls back to the ground where it started. Using the equations above, define all variables in a code cell and calculate the following values:\n",
    "    * What is the velocity at the maximum height?\n",
    "    * What is the time it takes to reach maximum height? What is the total time the ball is in the air?\n",
    "    * What is the maximum height?\n",
    "    * What is the velocity as it hits the ground again?\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Take the same situation as above, but this time when the ball leaves the ground, a hole appears and has a depth of 5 meters. Do the following values change, yes or no? If no, why? If yes, what is the new values?\n",
    "    * Acceleration due to gravity?\n",
    "    * Maximum height?\n",
    "    * Time the ball is in the air? \n",
    "    * Velocity of the ball before hitting the ground? (or bottom of hole)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Go back to the situation in problem 1. Now, assume the ball is on the moon with an acceleration due to gravity of 1.625 m/s$^2$. \n",
    "    * What is the time it takes to reach maximum height? What is the total time the ball is in the air?\n",
    "    * What is the maximum height?\n",
    "    * What is the velocity as it hits the ground again?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. If you finish the above, use the internet (or ask me) to find an equation in physics. In a code cell, define values for the variables and try to write the equation. "
