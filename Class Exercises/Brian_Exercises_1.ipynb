For each problem I want a markdown cell that has the number of the problem you are solving, a brief description with what the problem is asking and a few sentences that explain how you plan to write the code. You do not need to have each problem in one code cell, use as many as necessary. Use comments in each line of the code cells to explain the commands being used. \n",
